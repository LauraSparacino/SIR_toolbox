# SIR_toolbox
The SIR Matlab Toolbox performs computation of time and frequency domain information measures of entropy rate (ER), mutual information rate (MIR) and O-Information rate (OIR), exploiting both parametric and non-parametric estimation of the power spectral density of (blocks of) interacting stochastic processes.
